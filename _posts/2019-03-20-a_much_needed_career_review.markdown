I started my professional career motivated by an experience when I was 17 years old. I had a car accident that left me crushed physically and emotionally. By the time I was ready to start college I had moved to Seattle, Washington and was following my heart by pursuing a degree in mental health in order to help those who were negotiating trauma. Now, living in Seattle - home of a large tech industry - I made many friends who were developers. They explained their job to me and I found myself intrigued. I grew up with a mother who loved puzzles and logic and passed that love on to me. I considered taking a beginning coding class during my undergrad to see if it was something I wanted to pursue but was unable to fit it into my schedule. So long story short, I finished with a Master’s degree and began my career as a therapist.  

Being a therapist was rewarding but challenging. Most of the companies that employed therapists required them to make home visits and have very long days with little negotiation in schedules.  Something that did not work for me, as accessibility to these homes was an issue as well as scheduling needed medical appointments to keep myself healthy.  Six years ago, I took a break from my chosen career and went back to school at the University of Washington for computer science. I loved the classes and learned a good amount of Java. After a year, life circumstances made it impossible at the time to keep going to school and I returned to work.  

Jump to the end of 2018. I was getting pretty tired of work, both emotionally, physically, and even monetarily. Motivated by talks with my partner and friends who were developers I decided it was time for a career review. The pros side of the list for software development was overwhelming (to name a few...higher pay, I get to solve little puzzles, always learning, remote work...the list went on). Not only this, but tech companies like Microsoft are focusing on including those with disabilities into their ranks and making accessible products. Something, I think is amazing and want to contribute to.  I was not convinced traditional school was the way I wanted to go this time around. I began to take a hard look at other options like certification courses. I finally decided on the well-regarded Flatiron School to get a certification in software development. So here I am, talking to you at the beginning of this journey. Full of excitement and a little nervous. Nothing new when making a change. And if life is anything, it’s a series of changes, thanks for sharing this one with me.
